Ping Pong Game
This is a simple Ping Pong game built using Python and the Tkinter library for graphical components. Players can control the left and right paddles to prevent the ball from going out of bounds, scoring points each time their opponent misses.

Features
Two Paddle Controls:
The left paddle is controlled with W (up) and S (down).
The right paddle is controlled with the Up and Down arrow keys.
Ball and Paddle Collisions: The ball bounces off paddles and the window borders.
Score Tracking: The score for each player updates when a player scores.
Colorful Design: The paddles, ball, and score labels are set in vibrant colors to enhance the visual appeal.
